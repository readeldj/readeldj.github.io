title: Keeping busy with Coding and Electronics

---
  I've been interested in the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} hardware for a while and finally invested in a kit plus some more. I started with an Uno board and the blinking LED program. I then grabbed an ultrasonic range finder and started fabing up a garage parking sensor. I got that working with just a Red, Yellow, and Green LED and decided next would be a display. I quickly decided I needed a bigger breadboard, shift registers, 7 segment LEDs, a new Micro board.... I've ordered more parts and started more coding but have stopped for now. Summer time has taken over, I'll get started again in August when Jr Sith Lord goes back to school.
