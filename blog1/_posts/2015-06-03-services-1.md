Currently we have the one eight year old boy. I've started him down the correct path when it comes to toys and cool stuff. He was a big Transformers fan and has watched all the old 80s comics along with the latest movies. But that doesn't even come close to his love of Star Wars, I couldn't be prouder.

I started him off with the Star Wars Clone Wars cartoons, but not all of them. Once he showed a fair bit of interest we started watching the movies in the original order, the proper way. He's seen all six movies and the original 3 are his favorite. We've watched all the Clone Wars cartoons and watch the new Rebels series regularly. We anxiously await the 7th movie.

We did a family trip to Disney World in Oct 2014. We spent a lot of time at Universal Studios. He even did the Jedi Training Academy and dueled with the Dark Lord himself. Thats the picture at the very top. What you can't tell in the pic is that he's wearing a Darth Vader shirt at the time. That's his favorite character, he'd readily follow the Dark Side if he could.
