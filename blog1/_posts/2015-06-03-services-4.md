I like a little technology at home, but not everybody likes to deal with the custom hard to remember stuff at home. I setup a home NAS many years ago using old PC parts I had laying around and Open Source Software. It worked and met my requirements, but others in the household didn't care for it. It wasn't super user friendly if you didn't play with it regularly. So I learned a few things from that, one being don't over tech things for everybody else.

But when the wife complained about coming home to a dark house I knew I could spend some money and play a bit. I bought a Vera Edge Home Controller, a few Z-Wave light switches and a few other sensors. Now the outside lights come on before dusk and can be controlled via an iPhone App. Everybody's happy. Next project for that will be tieing in the garage door opener.

I've also installed 2 Honeywell Smart Thermostats to control the HVAC. It seems every house we rent our buy I'm always replacing the thermostats and installing ceiling fans. These can also be controlled via an iPhone App.
