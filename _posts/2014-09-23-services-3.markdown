Do you like Tex Mex but hunger for something a little fancier than $12 fajitas? I've eaten a lot of Tex Mex over the years and tend to like it all, even off the "Roach Coaches" before they were called Food Trucks and became trendy. I even enjoyed the food bout out of coolers on the side of the road in South Texas. But one time in Arizona a friend took us out to a "Fancy" Mexican restaurant and I was impressed. The experience was no other Tex Mex before. Since then I've looked for a similar place with no luck. That changed recently when we decided to check out Urban Spoon and look for a Mexican Place that we haven't tried. That led us to [Sopapillas](http://sopapillas.com/) in Franklin, TN. The food was great and a little spicy. I like a little spice as it goes great with beer. I highly recommend this place to others, but do warn that everything was a little spicy, even the kids tacos.
