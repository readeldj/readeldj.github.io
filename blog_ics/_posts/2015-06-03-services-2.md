I left the GoM in April 2010 about 2 weeks before the loss of the Deepwater Horizon. I had been working on Marlin for about 10yrs and was interested in a new challenge. I went to work on BP's Greater Plutonio(GPL) FPSO in May 2010. This Facility had an Emerson DeltaV DCS and many other systems I'd yet to work with. The role was as an ICSS Specialist on a 28/28 day rotation. The goals were to Maintain the facility and train the National Workforce to eliminate us. There were 4 others in the ICS Dept that I lead and in the end 4 more in the Tele Comms Dept. This was a great exercise in working in a Multi National Team, just in my dept we were American, Angolan, Pilipino, Indian, Algerian, and British.

Projects I helped to complete include:

* DeltaV Upgrade from v7.4 to v10.3.1.
* Matrikon OPC upgrades(DeltaV PCS to FMC CDM).
* DeltaV Simulator creation.
* 2 Major TARS.
* DeltaV Controller upgrades(MD+ and MX as required).
* DeltaV Firmware updates(twice).
* Gas Export system to Angola LNG Plant.
* Rework and startup of Water Injection.
* Commissioned Multiple new SubSea Wells.
* PID tuning via Pro-Tune.
* CCC compressor Surge Test/Tune.
* Rosemount Wireless HART Gateway and Transmitters.
