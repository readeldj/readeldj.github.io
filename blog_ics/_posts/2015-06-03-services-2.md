I left the GoM in April 2010 about 2 weeks before the loss of the Deepwater Horizon. I had been working and Marlin for about 10yrs and was interested in a new challenge. I went to work on BP's Greater Plutonio(GPL) FPSO in May 2010. This Facility had an Emerson DeltaV DCS and many other systems I'd yet to work with. The role was as an ICSS Specialist on a 28/28 day rotation. There were 4 others in the ICS Dept that I lead and in the end 4 in the Tele Comms Dept.

Projects I helped to complete include:

* DeltaV Upgrade from V7.4 to V10.3.1
* Matrikon OPC upgrades(DeltaV PCS to FMC CDM)
* DeltaV Simulator creation
* 2 Major TARS
* DeltaV Controller upgrades(MD+ and MX as required)
* DeltaV Firmware updates(twice)
* Gas Export system to Angola LNG Plant
*
