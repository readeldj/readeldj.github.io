title: How I got started in the Oilfield
description: |
---

I was raised in Natchez, MS. I signed up for Electronics Technology at the local Community College, [Co-Lin Community College](http://www.colin.edu/){:target="_blank"}. But I was 1 of 2 who signed up for this. I thought it would be great to work on TVs and VCRs and such for a living. But since only 2 of us signed up, the Dept Head called me in and discussed signing up for Instrumentation and Electronics instead since they wouldn't be teaching the other course. So I did and glad for it. Who knew your electronics were going to get dated so fast and become mostly disposable now. Before school completed I landed an interview with TEST Inc in Lafayette, LA and was offered a job. The only job offer at home was as a Xerox technician. Both paid the same, but the job market at home wasn't going to get better. After graduating from college in Dec 1997 I moved to Louisiana to start a career in the Oilfield.

I started out doing basic I&E construction, hanging brackets, running tray, bending tubing, pulling wire, terminating connections and so on. We built small skids to large vessels. We built platforms on the ship yards and sent them out. I did a lot of construction on Chevron's Genesis Spar on McDermott's yard in New Iberia, LA. I then went offshore for the first time to help commission it. I was hooked then, I enjoyed the work. And work continued, construct, commission, and service. I was always working on something new and got to see a lot of new places. As I did service jobs offshore I thought it must be terrible to work a steady Maintenance Job on a rotation 7 or 14 days at work and then 7 to 14 days off, you worked the same place all the time. But then I had to fill in for someone for a few rotations and got the time off. I saw the attraction then, almost half the year off. I soon parted ways with TEST for a Maintenance Job contracting for Shell. Shell staffed up for Y2K because nobody was certain exactly how smooth that would go. Shortly after Y2K Shell turned that field over to a single contractor. My company didn't win the bid and work got slow. I ended up going to work for Omega Natchiq after that and did Maintenance and Construction until I landed in the Grand Isle field in a Maintenance roll again.
