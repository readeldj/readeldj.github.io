title: How I got started in the Oilfield

---

I was raised in Natchez, MS. I attended college there at [Co-Lin Community College](http://www.colin.edu/){:target="_blank"} and recieved a degree in "Instrumentation and Electronics". Unfortunetly the only big employer in town for such work was International Paper Company and when i graduated in 1997 they where on the way to closing the doors. I landed an interview with TEST Inc in Lafayette, LA and was offered a job. The only job offer at home was as a Xerox technician. Both paid the same, but the job market at home wasn't going to get better. So down below I-10 I moved and never looked back.

I started out doing basic I&E construction, hanging brackets, running tray, bending tubing, pulling wire etc. We built small skids to large vessels. We built platforms on the ship yards and sent them out. I did a lot of construction on Chevron's Genesis Spar on McDermotts yard in New Iberia, LA. I then went offshore for the first time to help commission it. I was hooked then, I enjoyed the work. And work continued, construct, commission, and service. I was always working on something new and got to see a lot of new places. As I did service jobs offshore I thought it must be terrible to work a steady Mainteneance Job on a rotation 7 or 14 days at work and them 7 to 14 days off, you worked the same place all the time. But then i had to fill in for someone for a few rotations and got the time off. I saw the attraction then, almost half the year off. I soon parted ways with TEST for a Maintenance Job contracting for Shell. Shell staffed up for Y2K because nobody was certain exactly how smooth that would go. Shortly after Y2K Shell turned that field over to a single contractor. My company didn't win the bid and work got slow. I ended up going to work for Omega Natchiq after that and did Maintenance and Construction until I landed in the Grand Isle field in a Maintenance roll again.
