title: Life in Grand Isle 43 Field

While Employed by [Omega Natchiq](http://www.asrcenergy.com/omega-natchiq-inc/){:target="_blank"} I spent about 10 months working in Vastar's GI 43 field. This was my first solid position in a rotational role as a Maintenance Technician. I did both electrical and instrument work. Mostly Troubleshooting small issues here and there. This was my first experience with Solar Turbines, some PLC controlled, several just relay controlled. Notable projects were rebuilding a small Generator package with the addition of a SLC, and installing a few PanelViews into older RTU systems. I ended up at Conoco's GC52 platform shortly after leaving here.
