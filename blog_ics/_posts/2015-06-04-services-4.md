I was working for [Omega Natchiq](http://www.asrcenergy.com/omega-natchiq-inc/){:target="_blank"} when I first started here, but after some time I switched over to [Kellogg Brown and Root](http://www.kbr.com/){:target="_blank"}. Conoco called it the "Systems" dept, again an I&E roll. The control system used a [Parker Interact HMI](http://www.parker.com/portal/site/PARKER/menuitem.de7b26ee6a659c147cf26710237ad1ca/?vgnextoid=fcc9b5bbec622110VgnVCM10000032a71dacRCRD&vgnextfmt=default&vgnextdiv=687362&vgnextcatid=2626074&vgnextcat=INTERACT%20DEVELOPMENT%20SOFTWARE&redirect=true){:target="_blank"} and [Rockwell PLC-5](http://ab.rockwellautomation.com/Programmable-Controllers/PLC-5){:target="_blank"} series PLCs. Also Solar Turbines with the same PLCs. This was a great place to work, the atmosphere and people were great. I learned a lot about power generation and switchgear while here. There was also a 4160VAC Soft Start system on each of the 3 gas compressors. I also obtained my HVAC certification while here and received a lot of experience in HVAC. I also visited Conoco's GC 184 TLWP a few times to help fill in when needed. This was the first TLWP in the Gulf of Mexico. This was a great place to work and I learned a lot but I could see this was not going to be a place with a lot of new projects and growth. I then started asking around for a place where I could learn more and grow faster. That's when I went to work on BP's Marlin TLP.
