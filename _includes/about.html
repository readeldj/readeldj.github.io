              <h2>About ME</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>I'm currently a student enrolled at <a href="http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/">Nashville Software School</a>. It's a six month boot camp training people in the science of software development focusing on full stack web development. I started in Cohort 8 in January of 2015 and will complete the course in June 2015. </p>
                <p>Professionally I'm titled as an "Automation Specialist" in the field of  Oil and Gas Production. My last employment was with <a href="http://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/about-bp/bp-worldwide/bp-in-angola.html">BP Angola</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm currently a 4 year resident of <a href="http://www.city-data.com/city/Spring-Hill-Tennessee.html">Spring Hill, TN</a>. Previously I've lived in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. But we grew tired of 2 seasons, poor schools, and flat land. So when I took the assignment to work in Africa I only needed to be close to a major airport. The two cities in the running at the time were Nashville or Austin, and Nashville had a better chance at snow and was a little closer to Florida beaches. So we sold the house and headed north. We are very pleased with the choice so far.</p>
                <p>But after 5 years of rotating a month on and month off in Angola and working in a non friendly work environment I was ready for a break. I signed up for Software Development Bootcamp and turned in my resignation. So I will try to combine the old and the new knowledge and have some fun with it on the next job.</p>
                <p>This first page here is about me at home and what I do with my off time. The "ICS Offshore" page goes more in depth of what I've done professionally and what I've worked with and where.</p>
                <p>This page is built using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is setup as a blog, 1 personal and 1 work related. It suits the purpose for now but will be under constant construction as I play and reinforce what I've been learning. Blog number 3 will be started after the summer. It will be dedicated to those who I think should move up here too.</p>
